# what's the purpose?

is intended to send packets to a given ip so that it can be determined if the target ip is online or offline.
if you have a lot of willpower and friends this script can be used for DDoS attacks,
but it is not recommended because the machine that will be sending the DDoS will be yours and that of your partners,
thus breaking the anonymity.
